# Code Refactor
During this task I attempted to take code for a business website and create more semantic HTML, as well as consolidating some of the code where possible. I started this task by taking the "div" containers and substituting them for more semantic code whenever possible. The code was originally full of "div" tags, and I converted many of them to tags such as "nav," for the top navigation bar, "section" for large sections of the webpage, and "header" for the top of the page. Going through and replacing the old code for more semantic HTML was the first task of this assignment.

After I completed converting the code to semantic HTML where I could, I was tasked with consolidating some of the CSS. The CSS was filled with classes only, no IDs, and had multiple sections of the webpage broken down and separated where it could have been condensed. I condensed much of the navigation bar's code in order to make it more readable and clear, as well as changing it from the original div class from the original HTML. I created IDs wherever there seemed to be repetitive code for one object, such as in the header and in the sidebar at the bottom of the page.
